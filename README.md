Project  Description Overview:
    This project is about monitoring a lab beaker container level , and humudity/temprature reading by ,sending a text, or SMS message to your personal smart phone.
These are the Phases had been accomplished, which are as follows

    Phase 1: Research of a qualified Interface Discovery Board
             The first part of designing is to determine an ideal interface microcontroller
        board that can easily deal with wireless networking, analog inputs, and
        Digital outputs.

    Phase 2: Testing the Input Sensors
                Once I have ordered my parts, I will begin phase two by working on
        getting the input device to work between the Micro-Controllers and the smart
        phone. The second step of this project is how to get measurement reading from
        both proposed sensors, and to do so, I will be coding in C.

    Phase 3: Testing the Output Sensors
            In this stage of the project, is how to get the output device to be fully
        functional through various types of testes procedures.

Obective:   
    The main purpose of this project to build a working prototype unit that can collect, detect, and send
data to wireless device.

Hardware:
    1. Input:
            A. Ultrasonic Range Detector
            B. Temperature and Humidity Sensor
                Humidity detector
            C. Arduino GSM Shield
    2. Output:
            A. RGB LCD Display
            B. Water Pump DC Motor
            C. Lab Beaker Container
            D. Addressable RGB LED
            E. DC Fan
            F. Android/ IOS SIM card Phone
    3. Operating System Discovery Board:
            Arduino Uno R3: 

Project Issues/regulation:
        This project is still in  development mode, which is not fully functional, I am not using any reference        projects ,only using written libraries written by arduino developers.I will be mentioning their names in the       project Source code.as an Open Source ,any outsider can comment and give feedback, for improving this project.
